/*
 * Generic popen() wrapper to return the output of the process and the
 * exit code (if desired).  This function returns an allocated string of
 * the output from the program that ran or NULL if there was no output.
 *
 * The first argument is a pointer to an int that will hold the exit code
 * from popen().  If this pointer is NULL, then the caller does not want
 * the exit code and the function does nothing.
 *
 * The second argument is the command followed by any additional arguments
 * that should be included with it.  Note that it is not a format string,
 * all of the subsequent arguments need to be strings because they all
 * get concatenated together.
